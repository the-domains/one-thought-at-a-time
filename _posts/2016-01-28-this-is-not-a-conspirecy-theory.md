there is little doubt in my mind.

we know very little but feel we know everything.

- we do not know that everything we do know has been provided to us by others with a particular agenda

- information was sieved through and packaged and structured and then delivered.

- we as little babies receive it.

- we accept it

- we construct our own conceptual frame work of what existence is - based on the information someone else has given us.

- we are not aware that all this is happening from an early age

- this is the worst kind of prison!!

- one the we build ourself 

- one that we have now idea exist!!!
