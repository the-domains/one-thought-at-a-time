the responsibility

people listen to you, people think about what you say, people trust to the degree that they may be willing to postpone their beliefs and try the one you present them with, try them out, change their life, bring about the results you promise them. you stand for what you promise other wise who are you to say anything? talking is taking responsibility on what you say. talking to others, they give you permission - permission is responsibility. you also have the responsibility to represent the source of the information as best as you can .if you do not do this then what are you do ing. but then of course you need to b e continuing on and on with talking. but just talking with no meaning that means nothing. so of course talking is responsibility to stand for something. if you do not know what you are standing for you might want to sit down or step down. or if you do know what you are standing for you may want to step up. step us the information you are giving others, step up your own meditation. meditations are what you sell. meditation that most people cannot appreciate. the content of the meditations is such opposite to the conceptual context of the listener that what ever you say will be misinterpreted.  but you owe to the people they need to hear the truth because only by hearing the same thing again and again the wall of their conceptual frame work will crack. only then the amrita of the protecting truth will slowly sip in like the sap of a tree being milked slowly
